# What this workshop is

A super friendly introduction to Machine Learning No previous experience expected, but knowing some python will help!

You can't learn EVERYTHING in ~2 hours, especially when it comes to Machine Learning! But you can learn enough to get excited and comfortable to keep working and learning on your own! 

- This course is for absolute beginners
- Ask Questions!
- Answer Questions!
- Help others when you can
- Its ok to get stuck, just ask for help!
- Feel free to move ahead
- Be patient and nice

We're not going to focus on the math behind the models. We're going to focus more on when and how to use a model. If you would like to go into the math and more about each model I encourage you to do so!

## About me:

Hello I'm [Sage Elliott](http://sageelliott.com/). I'm a Technology Evangelist here at Galvanize! For the past decade I've worked as a software and hardware engineer with Startups and Agencies in Seattle, WA and Melbourne, FL. I love making things with technology! 

I Originally got into Machine Learning by solving a manufacturing problem at my last job with computer vision, and I think its one of the coolest fields!

**Note:** I'm not a Galvanize Instructor, they're way better at teaching than I am!

# What is Machine Learning:


To put it very simply Machine Learning can usually be thought of using a statistical model built based on a dataset to solve a problem. 

Instead of explicitly programming an algorithm to do a specific task, we let it "learn" from data to find patterns and inference.

We'll see example of this soon!


###  Who uses Machine Learning?

More and more companies using making descions with data are using machine learning. Here are just a few examples that you've probably experiences as a customer.

#### Amazon

- Product Recommendations
- Amazon GO Computer Vision
- Alexa 
- Delivery Robots


#### Netflix

- Show & Movie Recommendations

#### Google

- Gmail Spam Filtering
- Google Assistance
- Youtube Content filtering & Recommendations
- Self Driving Cars

#### Apple

- Siri
- App Store Recommendations

#### Facebook

- Face Tagging Detection

#### Tesla

- Self Driving Cars

These companies use Machine Learning in many other ways!



### Machine Learning Applications

We talked about a some examples above from big companies we probably all know of. But here are several more types of applications that machine learning has become popular with.

#### Healthcare

- Cancer Detection
- X-Ray diagnostic 

#### Smart Home Devices

- Smart door Beel
- Smart Lights
- Security

#### Image generation

- [NVIDIAâ€™s Hyperrealistic Face Generator](https://medium.com/syncedreview/gan-2-0-nvidias-hyperrealistic-face-generator-e3439d33ebaf)
- video game Character or level generation
- [art generation](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/3/29/ai-art-just-got-awesome)


#### Agriculture

- Crop monitoring & planning

#### Supply Chain 

- Sourcing and Shipping Automation

#### Manufacturing 

- Quality Assurance
- Design


#### Fraud Detection

- Credit cards
- Product listings

You can see how all of these applications revolve around finding patterns in data!



# Types of Machine Learning:


## Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning uses a dataset that is labeled. In this context imagine having a list of features and a label(group) that those features belong to.


Here we have features(sepal length (cm), etc) and a label(Flower Species)

| sepal length (cm)  | sepal width (cm)  | petal length (cm)  | petal width (cm)  |  Species | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 |  3.5 |  1.4 |  0.2 | setosa| 
| 5.7	| 2.9 | 4.2 | 1.3 | versicolor | 
| 7.7 | 3.0  | 6.1  | 2.3  |  virginica |

We could use a full dataset with data like above to make a prediction of the flower species given only the Petal and Sepal Lengths.


Another good example of supervised learning is a email spam filter. 

Say we have a bunch of emails in our dataset and they all have a label of either `spam` or `not_spam`. We could then train a supervised learning model to look at all of those emails and pick up patterns that show up in the spam emails. There are probably certain words or formattiing that repeat them selves. If you've ever looked in your email spam folder you can probably pick out some of those things yourself!

There are 2 main types of supervised learning Classification and Regression:

### Classification

Classification tries to assign the correct label to a new piece of data not containing a label. Both examples above are good examples of classfication problems.

Spam filter would look at an email and decide if it should be labeled as `spam` or `not_spam`

We could be given a new flower measurment and we want to try to label it with the correct Species: `setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`

| sepal length (cm)  | sepal width (cm)  | petal length (cm)  | petal width (cm)  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 |  3.5 |  1.4 |  0.2 |  

According to a model I trained it thinks this would be `versicolor`. 


### Regression

Instead of predicting a label like classification, Regression predicts a value. 

This example has features `crime rate`, `Zoning`, `rooms`, `square footage` and a value `price`. 

| crime rate | Zoning  | rooms  | square footage  | price |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| .5 |  3.5 |  5 |  1400 |  100000 |
| .2 |  2 |  3 |  3000 |  50000 |
| .3 |  4 |  7 |  1800 |  150000 |

Unlike the classification example where we tried to predict what group features belonged to, we want to predict what value the features would have. This could be a number ranging anywhere! 

Given a list of new features from a house like below, we would then want to find out how much that house is worth by predicting a number value.

| crime rate | Zoning  | rooms  | square footage  |
|---|---|---|---|
| .7 |  4 |  2 |  1000 |


Some other examples to think about Predicting:
- Stock price 
- Age


This workshop is going to focus on supervised Machine Learning, but we'll talk briefly about some of the other types!


## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning uses a dataset that is not labeled and gains insight about its patterns.



### Clustering 

A common way of using unsupervised learning is clustering.

![iris](irisviz.png)

This picture shows an example of visualizing the [Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) we talked about before. We can see that there are features that relate to each species. If we didn't have those labels we could use unsupervised learning to create clusters seperating the groups out that would probably look pretty similar to this. We could then add a label to those clusters.


An example to think about is if you have a large dataset of customers. Maybe you would like to segment them out to cluster similar customers. 


## Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

Uses mixed dataset labeled with labeled and unlabeled to train the model and a combonation of supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

Semi Supervised Machine learning can be important to look into if you don't have enough labeled data to create a good model. Labeling and aquired labeled data can be extremely expensive / time consuming so developing a model that can use both types of data is super intriguing!  


Imagine trying to label every peice of information you get from a self driving car! You have a constant video feed, Lidar, and other sensors. 



## Reinforcment Learning

Reinforcment Learning is often used in a situation where an algorith can take an action in an envroment and recieve a `reward` based on making a good descion.

You see a lot of example of this type of machine learning used to make computers exccellent gamers!

A couple exmpales:

[Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)

[Flappy Bird](https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird)



## Deep Learning

Seperate topic Want to do a quick mention here. Let me know if you'd like to see a workshop on deep learning basics!

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. 

It uses layers of [Artificial Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) and can learn from data to change the weights of the neurons. 

[A Neural Network Playground - TensorFlow](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.24541&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) is a great place to start tinkering around and learning more about Artificiial Neural Networks! 



For this class we're going to stay focused on Supervised Machine learning. 

But what would you like to see a class on next?


## Supervised Learning Models

Some of the common models. Having an idea of what these do and applications they should be used for is important! I will only briefly go over them so please read more about them!
