Seperate topic Want to do a quick mention here. Let me know if you'd like to see a workshop on deep learning basics!

Example


## Supervised Learning Models

For this class we're going to focus on supervised learning. 


Some of the common models. Having an idea of what these do and applications they should be used for is important!

## Some Basics Terms

We can only scratch the surface of Machine Learning tonight in this workshop, so this is by no means everything you need to know, but it should help you get started!


fitting / training

overfitting

underfitting

cross validation

XGboost (I heard this term all the time when I was first starting out)


## Popular Python Machine Learning Libraries

Again this just some of them!




## Regression Project

Look at data. 

Look at expected outcome.

What model is good for this?

Prediction outcome: Classification or Regression?

# YOU MAKE IT THORUGH!

Did you learn something new?

Do you feel more comfortable with the ideas of Machine Learning?

Do you have an awesome idea you want to use try using machine learning? What is it?


## Recap

<details>
  <summary>What is a conditional in Python?</summary>
  
 A way to check if data meets a certain condition or not. `if` `elif` `else`.
