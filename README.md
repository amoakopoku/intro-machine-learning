# What this workshop is

A super friendly introduction to Machine Learning No previous experience expected, but knowing some python will help!

You can't learn EVERYTHING in ~2 hours, especially when it comes to Machine Learning! But you can learn enough to get excited and comfortable to keep working and learning on your own! 

- This course is for absolute beginners
- Ask Questions!
- Answer Questions!
- Help others when you can
- Its ok to get stuck, just ask for help!
- Feel free to move ahead
- Be patient and nice

We're not going to focus on the math behind the models. We're going to focus more on when and how to use a model. If you would like to go into the math and more about each model I encourage you to do so!

## About me:

Hello I'm [Sage Elliott](http://sageelliott.com/). I'm a Technology Evangelist here at Galvanize! For the past decade I've worked as a software and hardware engineer with Startups and Agencies in Seattle, WA and Melbourne, FL. I love making things with technology! 

I Originally got into Machine Learning by solving a manufacturing problem at my last job with computer vision, and I think its one of the coolest fields!

**Note:** I'm not a Galvanize Instructor, they're way better at teaching than I am!

## About you!

Give a quick Intro!

- Whats your name?
- Whats your background?
- Why are you interested in Machine Learning?



# What is Machine Learning:


To put it very simply Machine Learning can usually be thought of using a statistical model built based on a dataset to solve a problem. 

Instead of explicitly programming an algorithm to do a specific task, we let it "learn" from data to find patterns and inference.

We'll see example of this soon!


###  Who uses Machine Learning?

More and more companies using making descions with data are using machine learning. Here are just a few examples that you've probably experiences as a customer.

#### Amazon

- Product Recommendations
- Amazon GO Computer Vision
- Alexa 
- Delivery Robots


#### Netflix

- Show & Movie Recommendations

#### Google

- Gmail Spam Filtering
- Google Assistance
- Youtube Content filtering & Recommendations
- Self Driving Cars

#### Apple

- Siri
- App Store Recommendations

#### Facebook

- Face Tagging Detection

#### Tesla

- Self Driving Cars

These companies use Machine Learning in many other ways!



### Machine Learning Applications

We talked about a some examples above from big companies we probably all know of. But here are several more types of applications that machine learning has become popular with.

Healthcare

Smart Home Devices

Art / Character generation (nVidia face example)

Agriculture

Supply Chain 

Manufacturing 

Fraud Detection


All of these revolve around understanding complicated patterns!



# Types of Machine Learning:


## Supervised Learning

What is supervised ML?

### Classification

### Regression



## Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering 

### Association


## Reinforcment Learning

Example

## Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

Example

## Deep Learning & Neural Networks

Seperate topic Want to do a quick mention here. Let me know if you'd like to see a workshop on deep learning basics!

Example



For this class we're going to stay focused on Supervised Machine learning. 

But what would you like to see a class on next?


## Supervised Learning Models

Some of the common models. Having an idea of what these do and applications they should be used for is important! 

[Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)

[Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)

[K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)

[Support Vector Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine)

[Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)


# Some Basics Terms:

We can only scratch the surface of Machine Learning tonight in this workshop, so this is by no means everything you need to know, but it should help you get started!

fitting / training

### Bias:

Examples

##### overfitting

##### underfitting

cross validation

XGboost (I heard this term all the time when I was first starting out)

loss function

Gradient Decent


# Machine Learning with Python:

## Popular Python Data & Machine Learning Libraries

Again this just some of them, there are soooooo many.....



Pandas

Numpy

matplotlib

Scikitlearn

Tensorflow

Pytorch

Keras

NLTK

OpenCV



*note* about anaconda




## Regression Project

Boston House price

Look at data. 

Look at expected outcome.

What model is good for this?

Prediction outcome: Classification or Regression?

# YOU MADE IT THORUGH!

Did you learn something new?

Do you feel more comfortable with the ideas of Machine Learning?

Do you have an awesome idea you want to use try using machine learning? What is it?


## Recap

<details>
  <summary>What is a conditional in Python?</summary>
  
 A way to check if data meets a certain condition or not. `if` `elif` `else`.

## KEEP LEARNING!

Best way to learn is solving a problem you're excited about!
