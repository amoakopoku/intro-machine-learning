# What this workshop is

We're not going to focus on the math behind the models. We're going to focus more on when and how to use a model. If you would like to go into the math and more about each model I encourage you to do so!


# What is Machine Learning:


###  Who uses Machine Learning?




# Types of Machine Learning:


## Supervised Learning

### Classification

### Regression



## Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering 

### Association


## Reinforcment Learning

Example

## Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

Example

## Deep Learning & Neural Networks

Seperate topic Want to do a quick mention here. Let me know if you'd like to see a workshop on deep learning basics!

Example

For this class we're going to focus on Supervised Machine learning. 


## Supervised Learning Models

Some of the common models. Having an idea of what these do and applications they should be used for is important! 

[Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)

[Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)

[K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)

[Support Vector Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine)

[Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)


# Some Basics Terms:

We can only scratch the surface of Machine Learning tonight in this workshop, so this is by no means everything you need to know, but it should help you get started!

fitting / training

### Bias:

##### overfitting

##### underfitting

cross validation

XGboost (I heard this term all the time when I was first starting out)

loss function

Gradient Decent


# Machine Learning with Python:

## Popular Python Data & Machine Learning Libraries

Again this just some of them, there are soooooo many.....



Pandas
Numpy
Scikitlearn
Tensorflow
Pytorch
Keras
NLTK
OpenCV



*note* about anaconda




## Regression Project

Look at data. 

Look at expected outcome.

What model is good for this?

Prediction outcome: Classification or Regression?

# YOU MADE IT THORUGH!

Did you learn something new?

Do you feel more comfortable with the ideas of Machine Learning?

Do you have an awesome idea you want to use try using machine learning? What is it?


## Recap

<details>
  <summary>What is a conditional in Python?</summary>
  
 A way to check if data meets a certain condition or not. `if` `elif` `else`.
